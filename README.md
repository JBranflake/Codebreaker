##Instructions
The object of this game is to guess the *secret* code in the **fewest** guesses possible. The secret code is randomly generated by the RNG in the program. (insert link to line of code that has random number generator) By default, the secret code is four digits long and the range of digits allowed is 0 through 6. Both of these variables can be changed in the main file. A longer span of digits or a range of digits that allows more numbers adds difficulty. (move this?)

The player's input shows to the right of the "Enter Code:" text.

After the player makes their? guess, the computer displays the guess under the "YOUR GUESSES" text. Under "CORRECT", the computer displays the number of digits that are the correct digit **AND** are in the correct spot. Under "MISPLACED", the computer tells the number of digits that are the correct digits but **NOT** in the correct spot.
