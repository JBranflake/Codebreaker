##Introduction
Welcome to Codebreaker! The code for this project was written for a C++ programming course.

##Installation
Click [here](https://github.com/JBranflake/Codebreaker/archive/master.zip) to download the zip folder that contains the program files. If that does not work, click the "Clone or download" button and select the option "Download Zip". Next, find the zip folder in your downloads folder. Unzip the folder to a convenient location. Finally, open the "main" file in a C++ IDE.

##Instructions
The object of this game is to guess the *secret* code in the **fewest** guesses possible. The secret code is generated by running a [random number generator](https://github.com/JBranflake/Codebreaker/blob/master/main.cpp#L151) through a [code generator](https://github.com/JBranflake/Codebreaker/blob/master/main.cpp#L139) function. By default, the secret code is four digits long and the range of digits allowed in the code are 0 through 6.

The player's input shows to the right of the "Enter Code:" text. After the user makes a guess, the computer displays the guess in the "YOUR GUESSES" column. The column under "CORRECT" displays the number of digits that are correct **AND** in their correct spots. The column under "MISPLACED" shows the number of digits that are correct but are **NOT** in their correct positions.

##Example Gameplay

This gameplay is based off of the defaults settings of having a digit range of 0 through 6 and a code length of 4 digits. The example logic provided would need to be changed if either of these settings were adjusted. See [customizations](https://github.com/JBranflake/Codebreaker/blob/master/README.md#customizations) for information on changing these features.

In this example, the player's first guess is "1234". This yields 0 correct and 2 misplaced. This means that two of the digits from the input are in the secret code, but are not in their correct positions.

The player swaps the 1 for a 2 and guesses "2234". This yields 1 correct and 0 misplaced. The only digit that was changed was the first one, so having 1 more correct digit means that the changed digit is now in its correct position. The player can safely assume that the first digit is a "2".

The player can also assume that "1" is in the secret code because there are 0 misplaced digits. If "1" was not in the secret code, the number of misplaced would have instead gone from 2 to 1 because the "2" was put in its correct position.

The player guesses "2314" to confirm that the first digit is a "2". There is now 1 misplaced, so the "1" is not in the correct position. The "1" should either be in the second or fourth digit's place.

The player also knows that there is not a "3" or a "4" in the secret code. If they were, there would be *more* than one misplaced digit.

Since the player knows that neither "3" nor "4" are in the secret code, he simply moves the "1" to make it easy to discern small changes. A guess of "2134" yields two correct! The player now knows that the second digit of the secret code is a "1". Since there are 0 misplaced digits, there is not a "3" or a "4" in the secret code.

Tip: If you are certain that one or more digits are not in the secret code, include them in your guesses. This technique makes it much easier to figure out which digits are in the secret code.

Because the player knows that neither "3" nor "4" are in the secret code, the player includes the only other two possible digits in his next guess of "2165". This result in 2 misplaced. This means that the last two digits of the secret code are "5" and "6". The player simply has to swap the "6" and the "5" to win the game.

Victory! The secret code was "2156".  The computer displays a congratulatory message and the number of guesses. The player is prompted to enter "Y" or "N" to playing another game. 

Note: *Most* games require more than 5 guesses.

##Customizations

The length and span of digits of the secret code can be changed in the ["main"] (https://github.com/JBranflake/Codebreaker/blob/master/main.cpp#L9) file. An increase in either of these adds difficulty. Here is a chart displaying various settings and their corresponding difficulties.

| Code Span | Code Length | Difficulty|
|-----------|------------|------------
| 4 digits  | 3 digits   | Easy       |
| 6 digits  | 4 digits   | Medium     |
| 8 digits  | 5 digits   | Hard       |
| 9 digits  | 6 digits   | EXTREME    |

##Acknowledgements

The professor of my C++ course provided the random number generator and player input functions for this assignment. I wrote the game logic, secret code generator, and header file. The title was made using a text-to-ASCII art generator found on  [this](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow&t=Type%20Something%20) website.
